                        <li>Whether you’re passenger or a driver, keep car doors locked. Be particularly alert in parking lots and garages. Park near an entrance.</li>
                        <li>Keep your money in several pockets instead of one pocket. Carry your purse close to your body, not dangling by the straps. Put a wallet in an inside coat or front pants pocket.</li>
                        <li>Sit close to the driver or near the exit while riding the bus, train, or subway.</li>
                        <li>If someone or something makes you uneasy, trust your instincts and leave.</li>
                        <li>Project an image of self-confidence while walking.</li>
                        <li>If you fell that you are being followed, cross the street.</li>
                        <li>Never accept a ride from a stranger or unknown person.</li>
                        <li>Don't get out of the car if there are suspicious individuals nearby. Drive away. If you suspect someone is following you, drive to the nearest service station, restaurant, or business and call the police or sheriff's department. If you believe it is unsafe to get out of your car, honk your horn and flash your lights to draw attention.</li>
                        <li>Never pick up hitchhikers. Do not stop to offer help to a stranded motorist. Go to a telephone booth and call for assistance.</li>

                  <div class="card-body">
                    <ul class="ml-4">
                        <li>During an earthquake, assume the "earthquake position". If you are indoors, drop down to the floor in the "earthquake position". Make yourself small, with your knees on the floor, and your head tucked down toward the floor. Take cover under a sturdy desk or table. Place one hand on a leg of the table (to keep it from shifting away from you) and one hand over the back of your neck. Alternatively get down low next to a solid sofa or armchair and cover your head and neck with a pillow. Stay clear of windows, fireplaces, wood stoves, and heavy furniture or appliances that may fall over. Stay inside to avoid being injured by falling glass or building parts.</li>
                        <li>If you are indoors, stay indoors; if you are outdoors, stay there. During earthquakes, most injuries occur as people are entering or leaving buildings. If indoors, take cover under a heavy desk, table, bench, in a supported doorway, or along an inside wall. Stay away from glass and fireplaces. Do not use candles, matches, or other flame either during or after the tremor because of possible gas leaks. Douse all fires.</li>
                        <li>If in a high-rise building, get under a desk or similar heavy furniture. Do not dash for exits because stairways may be broken or jammed with people. Never use elevators because power may fail.</li>
                        <li>Pick a safe place where things will not fall on you.</li>
                        <li>Never use the elevator to move out of a building. Use the stairs instead.</li>
                        <li>If outdoors, move away from buildings and power lines and streetlights. The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls.</li>
                        <li>If in a moving car, stop as quickly as safety permits, but stay in the vehicle and keep low. A car may jiggle violently on its springs, but it is a good place to stay until the shaking stops. When you resume driving, watch for hazards created by the earthquake, such as fallen or falling objects, downed electrical wires, or broken or undermined roadways.</li>
                        <li>Most important: STAY CALM. Think through the consequences of any action you take.</li>

                    <ul class="ml-4">
                        <li>Be prepared for additional earthquake tremors, or "aftershocks." Although most of these are smaller than the main shock, some may be large enough to cause additional damage or bring weakened structures down.</li>
                        <li>Check for injuries. Do not attempt to move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger of further injury.</li>
                        <li>Turn on your radio or television to get the latest emergency information from local authorities.</li>
                        <li>Check your utilities. The earthquake may have broken gas, electrical, and water lines. If you smell gas, open windows and shut off the main gas valve. Then leave the building and report the leakage to authorities. Do not reenter the building until a utility official says it is safe. If electrical wiring is shorting out, shut off current at the main meter box. If water pipes are damaged, shut off the supply at the main valve.</li>
                        <li>Check to see that sewage lines are intact before using sanitary facilities.</li>
                        <li>Do not touch downed power lines or objects in contact with downed lines.</li>
                        <li>Immediately clean up spilled medicines, drugs, flammable liquids, and other potentially hazardous materials.</li>
                        <li>Use the telephone only for genuine emergency calls. Do not spread rumors; they often do great harm after disasters</li>
                        <li>Stay away from damaged areas. Your presence could hamper emergency relief efforts, and you could be putting yourself in personal danger. Cooperate fully with public-safety officials. Respond to requests for volunteer assistance from police and fire-fighting, civil-defense, and relief organizations, but do not go into damaged areas unless your assistance has been requested.</li>
